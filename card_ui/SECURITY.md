# Security Policy

I take the security of my Flutter package very seriously and strive to provide a secure and reliable experience for my users. As a result, I have put in place the following guidelines to ensure that my package remains secure:

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability
If you have discovered a security vulnerability, please report it to me by emailing my security team at utpal.barman.bd@gmail.com. I ask that you please do not create a public issue for security vulnerabilities to avoid exposing the vulnerability to others before it can be resolved.

Please provide as much detail as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact that it may have on my users.

## My Commitment
I am committed to promptly addressing and resolving any security vulnerabilities that are reported to me. Once I receive a report, I will work quickly to assess the vulnerability and develop a plan for fixing it.

I will provide regular updates on the progress of my efforts to resolve the vulnerability, including any patches or updates that are released.

## Disclosure Policy
I follow a responsible disclosure policy, which means that I will not disclose any security vulnerabilities until a fix has been developed and released. I ask that all users of my package also follow this policy and refrain from publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities until they have been resolved.

## Keeping Your Package Secure
I strongly recommend that you keep your version of my package up to date with the latest releases and patches to ensure that you are using the most secure version of the package.

In addition, I recommend that you follow security best practices when using my package, such as:

- Avoiding the use of third-party libraries that have known security vulnerabilities
- Ensuring that your own code is secure and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities into my package
- Using encryption and other security measures to protect sensitive data that may be passed through my package

Thank you for your cooperation in keeping my Flutter package secure.
